# tethys_browser

Welcome back to one of my Git repo; this time I share the code to build a basic Python browser to get you familiar with PyQT5.

 The project shouldn't take more than 10 min (max) to be understood and compiled.

 Requirements:

 I advise you to install PyQT5 before running the code:

 pip3 install PyQT5
 pip3 install pyqtwebengine

 Run and let me know you like it!

 What if we were to add more features to it? Let's see where we can take this project.
